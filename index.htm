<a name="About_the_School_">About the School</a></h3>

<p align="left">The Oxford School on Neutron Scattering is intended for 
scientists and engineers who are new to the field of neutron scattering. 
Lectures and tutorials covering the theory and practice of neutron diffraction 
and spectroscopy are given by international experts. Students will gain a 
comprehensive grounding in modern techniques and applications at both continuous 
and pulsed neutron sources and have the opportunity to hear about the latest 
research being carried out with the technique.</p>
	<hr>
    <h3 align="left"><a name="Programme_">Programme</a></h3>
	
    <p align="left">The first week of the school introduces students to the core concepts of neutron scattering, neutron sources and instrumentation, neutron diffraction and spectroscopy. The second week splits tuition into three focused science areas, physics, chemistry and soft/bio, and provides lectures on neutron techniques and concepts which are most relevant to each area. Each lecture will be accompanied by a tutorial session. The students will be asked to make short presentations to their peers about their current research projects and work in pairs to write a beamtime proposal. The students will also have the opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/">ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility</a> in Didcot, and to attend a number of evening lectures from prestigious names from the neutron community. In addition, this year are providing an option maths refresher for those students who may want it.</p>
	
	<!-- The <a href="2017/web_timetable_template.pdf">2017 school programme
	</a>consists of lectures, tutorials and problem classes taking place each 
	weekday with occasional evening lectures. In addition, students make short 
	presentations to their tutorial groups about their current research 
	projects, and go through a neutron beam-time proposal writing exercise.</p>
    <p align="left">There will also be a visit to the nearby 
	<a href="http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk">ISIS Neutron 
    and Muon Source</a>.</p> -->
