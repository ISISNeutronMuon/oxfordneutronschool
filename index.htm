	There’s a little bit more than a month to go. In preparation for the start of the school please read and action the following where appropriate: <br><br>
	<b>Payment of School Fee</b></p>
	<p align="left">
	The site is up and running now. Please proceed to payment on <a href="https://cvent.me/8BP3AR?RefId=OSNS2022" target="_blank">https://cvent.me/8BP3AR?RefId=OSNS2022</a>. Choose the appropriate registration type, residential or non-residential, and pay £700 or £200 respectively. <u>Payments can only be made with a credit card</u>. You should receive a confirmation of payment to the email address that you provided on the form. We will then separately send you an official receipt. For those covered by the ISIS-Indian funding agreement, I will make the payments only when you confirm receipt of your visa. So please keep us informed.<br></p>
	<p align="left">
	<b>Programme</b><br>
	The latest version of the school programme can be found <a href="https://www.oxfordneutronschool.org/2022/OSNS22_timetable-v4.pdf">here</a>. The school starts early morning on Monday 5th September at University of Oxford, so those of you who are residential please plan to arrive* on Sunday 4th. We will start the day with lectures and then have tutorials in the afternoon. As you will see, this is the general format of the school. In the afternoon of day 1, however, we will have some maths tutorial at 2pm. This is optional and will be a problem class for those of you that have questions, more info soon. You are all expected to be there for the neutron tutorials starting at 15:30. Monday will finish with a welcome reception at St. Anne’s College, at 6pm, for all students, residential and non-residential. On Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, you will be expected to present your area of work/project to the rest of the students. These should be up to 5 minute presentations and will not require slides (but you can use props or draw on the black/white-board).</p>

	<p align="left">
	<b>Visas</b><br>
	For those of you who have visa applications in progress, please do let us know as soon as you can, of the outcome. </p>

	<p align="left">
	<b>Accommodation</b><br>
	For those of you with a residential place, we have booked accommodation from Sunday 4th September to Friday 16th September. Please do let us know ASAP if you need extra days (will be considered by exception only and is not guaranteed). </p>

	<p align="left"><strong> 20th July 2022</strong></p>
	<p align="left">
	We are experiencing some delays in setting up the payment page. We are doing our best to get this up and running.

	Thank you to everybody who applied to this year’s OSNS. The student selection has been completed and all students have been informed of the outcome. 
		We ask successful students to accept their place by <b>Wed 22nd June</b>, otherwise your place may be offered to someone else. 
		For those students who require visitor visas to enter the UK, you will need to apply yourself. We can provide a supporting statement if you let us know on the school's email
		<a href="mailto:osns@stfc.ac.uk?subject=Visa Supporting Letter">osns@stfc.ac.uk</a>. The visa application is your responsibility. 
		Please let us know when it has been granted. 
		Finally, instructions on how to pay for the registration fees will appear on the website in the next couple of weeks.

	<p align="left"><strong>30th January 2022</strong></p>
	<p align="left">
	We are very happy to be able to welcome students back at our in-person school. Applications are now being taken.  

<a href="index.htm#Costs_and_Registration_"><strong>Applications</strong> </a>should arrive no later than mid-night <strong>1st June 2022</strong>. 
<br>
The course is normally highly oversubscribed, so we encourage applicants to apply in plenty of time, as late applications will not be accepted. Applicants are selected for the course based on their requirements for neutron scattering techniques as part of their present and future research activities. Applicants will be notified shortly after of the outcome of their application. The school is open to all applicants worldwide.

<a name="About_the_School_">About the School</a></h3>

<p align="left">The Oxford School on Neutron Scattering is intended for 
scientists and engineers who are new to the field of neutron scattering. 
Lectures and tutorials covering the theory and practice of neutron diffraction 
and spectroscopy are given by international experts. Students will gain a 
comprehensive grounding in modern techniques and applications at both continuous 
and pulsed neutron sources and have the opportunity to hear about the latest 
research being carried out with the technique.</p>
	<hr>
    <h3 align="left"><a name="Programme_">Programme</a></h3>
	
    <p align="left">The first week of the school introduces students to the core concepts of neutron scattering, neutron sources and instrumentation, neutron diffraction and spectroscopy. The second week splits tuition into three focused science areas, physics, chemistry and soft/bio, and provides lectures on neutron techniques and concepts which are most relevant to each area. Each lecture will be accompanied by a tutorial session. The students will be asked to make short presentations to their peers about their current research projects and work in pairs to write a beamtime proposal. The students will also have the opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/">ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility</a> in Didcot, and to attend a number of evening lectures from prestigious names from the neutron community. In addition, this year are providing an option maths refresher for those students who may want it.</p>
