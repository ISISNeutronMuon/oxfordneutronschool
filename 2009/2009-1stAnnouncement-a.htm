    <h3>First Announcement</h3>
    <p><b>4 February 2009<br>
	</b>School dates for the 11th Oxford School on Neutron Scattering have been 
	announced: 31 August - 12 September. We will have 50 residential places for 
	students available.</p>
	<p>The Oxford School on Neutron Scattering is intended primarily for scientists who are new to the field of neutron scattering 
	and has been teaching students for over 40 years. 
Lectures and tutorials covering all aspects of the theory and practice of 
neutron diffraction and spectroscopy will be given by international experts. Students will gain a comprehensive grounding in modern techniques and applications  
at both steady state and pulsed neutron sources and have the opportunity to hear about the latest research being carried out 
with the technique.</p>
	<p>More information about the legendary Oxford School on Neutron Scattering 
	can be found on our website <a href="http://www.oxfordneutronschool.org">
	www.oxfordneutronschool.org</a> and on our
    <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6066660809&ref=mf">Facebook 
    group (Oxford Neutron School)</a>.</p>

    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
    <p>Accommodation will be provided in single rooms in Oxford from Monday 31 
	August 2009 to Saturday 12 September 2009. Breakfast and 
	evening meals will be provided for each day of the 
	school. </p>
	<p>Students will be expected to arrive on Monday 31 August and depart on

    <h3>School fees</h3>
    <p>50 places are available for students attending the school. The cost per 
	student for the Oxford School on Neutron Scattering will be around £425 
    (€ 480) - final cost to be confirmed for 2009. We regret that bursaries are 
	not available from the school since we 
    use money from our supporting partners to reduce the total cost per 
    student for all students.</p>
    <p>You may be able to attract sponsorship or contributions to the school 
    fees from learned societies or government science agencies in your home 
    country.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Social programme</h3>
    <p>A lively social programme is planned and there will be opportunities for punting on the Oxford rivers, 
	visiting historic places and exploring the city.</p>
