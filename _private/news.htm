<meta name="description" content="The 9th Oxford School on Neutron Scattering is intended 
primarily for scientists who are new to the field of neutron scattering. 
Lectures and tutorials covering all aspects of the theory and practice of 
neutron diffraction and spectroscopy will be given by international experts. 
Techniques and applications at both steady state and pulsed neutron sources 
are covered, and the school gives the opportunity to hear about some of the exciting new
research being carried out in neutron scattering.">
