About the School</h3>

<p>The Oxford School on Neutron Scattering, established in 1989, is intended 
primarily for scientists who are new to the field of neutron scattering. 
Lectures and tutorials covering all aspects of the theory and practice of 
neutron diffraction and spectroscopy will be given by international experts. Techniques and applications at both steady state and pulsed neutron sources 
are covered, and the school gives the&nbsp; opportunity to hear about some of the exciting new
research being carried out in neutron scattering. Participants in the School are also encouraged to give a short overview of 
their own research during the tutorial sessions.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
    <p>Accommodation will be provided in single rooms in Mansfield College, 
    Oxford with lectures and tutorials taking place at the Martin Wood Complex, 
    Department of Physics, University of Oxford. There are a number of rooms at 
    Mansfield College with level ground-floor access, and the Martin Wood 
    Complex is fully accessible to all.</p>
    <p>Breakfast and evening meals will be provided at Mansfield College for 
    each day of the school. Meals for those with special diet requirements can 
    be provided if notification is given in advance.</p>
    <p>The college and lecture theatres are within walking distance of Oxford 
    railway station and coach station. Limited car parking is available on site 
    for a charge of &pound;5 per day.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>School fees and allocation of places</h3>
    <p>The cost per student for the Oxford School on Neutron Scattering is £ 325 
    (€ 486)</p>
    <p>There are 35 places available for students attending the school. Those 
    who have pre-registered will be offered places preferentially in the event 
    that the School is oversubscribed.</p>
    <p>The closing date for registrations is 1 August 2005 and applicants will 
    be notified if they have been accepted for the School by 5 August 2005.</p>
    <p>We are grateful to the CCLRC and NMI3 network for their generous 
    financial support. This has allowed us to offer substantial reductions in 
    school fees to all students. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able 
    to offer individual students further support either for travel fees or 
    attendance bursaries.</p>
    <p>Students may be able to obtain contributions 
    towards the cost of the summer school from university or company travel and 
    training funds or from subject interest groups of professional societies 
    such as the Institute of Physics or the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
    Applications should be made direct to these organisations.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Programme and course materials</h3>
    <p>The programme consists of lectures, tutorials and problem classes taking 
    place each week day from 0900 to 1700 with occasional evening lectures. In 
    addition, students are invited to make short presentations to the school 
    about their current research projects.</p>
    <p>All students will receive a copy of the classic neutron scattering text 
    book by Gordon Squires &quot;Introduction to the theory of thermal neutron 
    scattering&quot; in addition to copies of notes from the School lecturers.</p>
    <p>There will also be an opportunity to visit the nearby ISIS Pulsed Neutron 
    and Muon Source.</p>
    <p>Lecturers at this year&#39;s school will be:</p>
    <p>Professor Gerry Lander (EITU, Karlsruhe, Germany)<br>
    Dr Andrew Boothroyd (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK)<br>
    Dr Colin Carlile (Institut-Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France)<br>
    Professor Chick Wilson (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK)<br>
    Professor Jeff Penfold (ISIS, CCLRC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK)<br>
    Professor Bill Stirling (ESRF, Grenoble, France)<br>
    Professor Alan Soper (ISIS, CCLRC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK)<br>
    Dr Ross Stewart (Institut-Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France)<br>
    Professor Alberto Albinati (University of Milan, Milan, Italy)<br>
    Professor Roger Eccleston (Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK)<br>
    Professor Trevor Forsyth (Institut-Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France)<br>
    Dr Giovanni Bruno (Institut-Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France)<br>
    Dr Toby Perring&nbsp; (ISIS, CCLRC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK)</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Social programme</h3>
    <p>A lively social programme is planned including a drinks reception and 
    gala dinner. There will be opportunities for punting on the Oxford rivers 
    and visiting historic pubs.</p>
