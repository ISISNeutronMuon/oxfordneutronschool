About the School</h3>

<p>The Oxford School on Neutron Scattering, established in 1989, is intended 
primarily for scientists who are new to the field of neutron scattering. 
Lectures and tutorials covering all aspects of the theory and practice of 
neutron diffraction and spectroscopy will be given by international experts. 
Techniques and applications at both steady state and pulsed neutron sources are 
covered, and the school gives the&nbsp; opportunity to hear about some of the 
exciting new research being carried out in neutron scattering. Participants in 
the School are also encouraged to give a short overview of their own research 
during the tutorial sessions.</p>

    <h3>
<img border="0" src="../images/worldBlob.GIF" alt="" width="15" height="15">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School fees and allocation of places</h3>
    <p>The cost per student for the Oxford School on Neutron Scattering is £ 325 
    (€ 486)</p>
    <p>There are 35 places available for students attending the school. Those 
    who have pre-registered will be offered places preferentially in the event 
    that the School is oversubscribed.</p>
    <p>The closing date for registrations is 00:00 BST 6 July 2005 and applicants will 
    be notified if they have been accepted for the School by 5 August 2005.</p>
    <p>We are grateful to the CCLRC and NMI3 network for their generous 
    financial support. This has allowed us to offer substantial reductions in 
    school fees to all students. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able 
    to offer individual students further support either for travel fees or 
    attendance bursaries.</p>
    <p>Students may be able to obtain contributions 
    towards the cost of the summer school from university or company travel and 
    training funds or from subject interest groups of professional societies 
    such as the Institute of Physics or the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
    Applications should be made direct to these organisations.</p>

    <p>All school fees must be paid in advance and before 15 August 2005. 
    There will be no facilities for fee payment available during the school.</p>

</a>Programme and course materials</h3>

    <p><a href="../programme.htm">The <b>programme</b> consists of lectures, tutorials and problem classes</a> taking 
    place each week day from 0900 to 1700 with occasional evening lectures. In 
    addition, students are invited to make short presentations to the school 
    about their current research projects.</p>

    <p>The teaching language of the school will be English.</p>
    <p>All students will receive a copy of the classic neutron scattering text 
    book by Gordon Squires &quot;Introduction to the theory of thermal neutron 
    scattering&quot; in addition to copies of notes from the School lecturers.</p>
    <p>There will also be an opportunity to visit the nearby ISIS Pulsed Neutron 
    and Muon Source.</p>
