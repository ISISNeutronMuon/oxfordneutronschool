	Neutron Scattering kicks off, here is some essential information for you.</p>
	<h3 align="left"><a name="Accommodation">Accommodation</a></h3>
	<p align="left">All accommodation will be in Mansfield College, University 
	of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3TF <a href="http://www.mansfield.ox.ac.uk">
	http://www.mansfield.ox.ac.uk</a> <br>
	<br>
	To see the location of the College in Oxford, type the post code into Google 
	Maps <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">http://maps.google.co.uk</a> <br>
	<br>
	Oxford is well connected to all airports via the national rail network or 
	express buses. The best source of information on travel to Oxford and 
	activities in Oxford in general is the amazing Daily Information website
	<a href="http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/guide/index.html">
	http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/guide/index.html</a>&nbsp; </p>
	<h3 align="left"><a name="Late_arrivals">Late arrivals</a></h3>
	<p align="left">If you are going to be arriving after midnight at Mansfield 
	College, you must give advance warning so that someone can meet you.<br>
	Please call the Mansfield College Porter&#39;s Lodge before 2300 on the day of 
	your arrival. Their telephone number is +44 (0)1865 270999.<br>
	<br>
	The Porter&#39;s Lodge is closed 0000-0700 each day. <br>
	<br>
	If you fail to let the Porter&#39;s Lodge know you are arriving after midnight, 
	you will not get your room key, and you will have to sleep on the grass.</p>
	<h3 align="left"><a name="Car_Parking">No Car Parking</a></h3>
	<p align="left">There are no parking places for students at Mansfield 
	College and parking on the streets of Oxford is very,very expensive. We 
	recommend that you arrive in Oxford by train, bus, bicycle, boat, horse, on 
	foot, hot-air balloon etc.</p>
	<h3 align="left"><a name="Food">Food</a></h3>
	<p align="left">Breakfast and evening meals are provided every day. Lunch is 
	not provided, but there are many places around the centre of Oxford where 
	you can get very tasty food.</p>
	<h3 align="left"><a name="Student_Talks">Student Talks</a></h3>
	<p align="left">These sessions are an opportunity for you to practice 
	talking about your work to an interested audience who are not necessarily 
	experts in your field of research.<br>
	<br>
	All students are required to give a 5 minute presentation on some aspect of 
	their research or work. If you choose to use overhead transparencies, then 
	you may use a maximum of 3 during your talk. If explaining your work can be 
	enhanced by showing the audience interesting objects or using different ways 
	to communicate, please feel free to experiment!</p>
	<h3 align="left"><a name="School_registration_fees">School registration fees</a></h3>
	<p align="left">Many of you have sent us payment for the school. Thank you!
	<br>
	<br>
	For those of you who haven&#39;t paid yet, we&#39;d be very pleased to see your 
	registration fees arriving in the bank. See
	<a href="http://www.oxfordneutronschool.org">www.oxfordneutronschool.org</a>&nbsp; 
	for info on how to pay.</p>
	<h3 align="left">See you soon!</h3>

	to Oxford and we look forward to meeting you all in September.</p>
